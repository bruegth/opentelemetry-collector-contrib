  Enables extracting individual metrics from pivot-style result sets where each row
  represents a different metric (e.g. pgbouncer's `SHOW LISTS` command). When
  `row_condition` is configured on a metric, only rows where the specified column
  equals the specified value are used; all other rows are silently skipped.

# you should instead start your pull request title with [chore] or use the "Skip Changelog" label.

# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
